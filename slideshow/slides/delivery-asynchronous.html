<h2>Food Delivery</h2>

<p>Two scenarios:</p>

<ol>
  <li>You're cramming for a huge test and you're hungry. You stop studying, go to the kitchen, pull out your food, and cook it. You take your food back to your study table to eat. <strong>End result: you waste 20-30 minutes of your study time making food.</strong></li>
  <li>You're cramming for a huge test and you're hungry. You call your favorite restaurant and order delivery. You continue studying and eat your food out of the carton when it arrives. <strong>End result: you spend $20, and you can keep studying.</strong></li>
</ol>
