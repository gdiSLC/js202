<h2>Dynamic Content</h2>

<p>Upgrade!</p>

<p>Our content isn't static anymore: it's real, live data. We get it from a database (somewhere, more on that later) and use JavaScript and jQuery to display it how we want.</p>

<img src="img/dynamic_content.png">

<p>A good example of this are things like Gmail, Facebook, and Twitter.</p>
