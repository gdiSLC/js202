<h2>Shoes: synchronous</h2>

<p>You can't put on your second shoe until you finish putting on your first shoe.</p>

<p>If you stop putting on your first shoe, it doesn't put itself on.</p>

<p><strong>Putting on a pair of shoes is a synchronous activity.</strong></p>

<p><small>Don't sass me and tell me you can put on two shoes at once.</small></p>
