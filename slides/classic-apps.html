<h2>Classic apps</h2>

<p>The classic data-driven web app is written so that it:</p>

<ul>
  <li>displays a webpage</li>
  <li>waits for user interaction</li>
  <li>queries the server for data</li>
  <li>reloads the webpage</li>
</ul>

<p>This has the effect that the user has "down time" - there is a period of time where they can't interact with the webpage at all.</p>
