<h2>Develop It! Exercise 1</h2>

<p>Open the <code>json_starter.html</code> file from the class exercises.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Add an additional video to the JSON, so that you have 4 videos listed.</li>
  <li>When you click on the video, it shows the video player on the side. Make it so that it also shows an h2 with the video title above the iframe.</li>
  <li>Add an "author" property to each video in the JSON and display that next to the title.</li>
  <li>Bonus: Add a "favorite" property to each video which is either true or false, and use that
to decide whether to put a round red border around the video in the list.</li>
</ul>
